## Travis-CI

https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#Overview

> Travis CI runs builds in isolated virtual machines that offer a vanilla build environment for every build. This has the advantage that no state persists between builds, offering a clean state and making sure that your tests run in an environment built from scratch.

# Feature flags

# Global installs

how often i had to delete the whole folder

# Continuous Integration

Axel Hodler

Baut auf Erfahrungen die ich die letzten Jahre gesammelt habe. Entsprechend auch Interessiert an Diskussionen bzw euren Erfahrungswerten bzw einer gewisser Interaktivitaet wie ihr die einzelnen Punkte loest.

###_"Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline [...]"_[en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)

???
vague
often extended as a quality control.

---

# Why?

--

* Prevent integration problems.

--

* Integrating small pieces is easier than integrating days or months of work.

--

* Often extended with quality controls (Automated Tests, Code metrics ...)

---

# How often is continuous?

--

* "_[...] <span class="yellow-highlight">several times a day</span>. [...]_" [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)


--

* "_Developers should be integrating and commiting code into the code repository <span class="yellow-highlight">every few hours</span>, when ever possible. In any case __never hold onto changes for more than a day__"_ [extremeprogramming.org](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/integrateoften.html)


--

* "_We will check in our code <span class="yellow-highlight">every two to four hours</span>._" [James Shore - 2005](http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Continuous-Integration-is-an-Attitude.html)


--

* "_[...] usually each person integrates <span class="yellow-highlight">at least daily</span>" [Martin Fowler - 2006](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)

---

# German Wikipedia

--

* No exact timing mentioned in [Kontinuierliche Integration](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kontinuierliche_Integration).

--

* _"Jeder Entwickler <span class="yellow-highlight">sollte</span> seine Ã„nderungen <span class="yellow-highlight">so oft wie mÃ¶glich</span> in die gemeinsame Code-Basis integrieren"_

--

* Mention in [Extreme Programming](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming#Permanente_Integration):
"_[...] die Integration zu einem tÃ¤glichen Schritt gehÃ¶rt [...]_"

# Bad practices

---

# Build config is not in version control

--

* Only the jenkins administrators "know" how it is built

--

* Scripts are pasted into `Execute Shell` textareas in a Web UI

--

* No one knows what was changed when and why

---

# Build is not in version control - II

* Example: Jenkins job configuration crashed the browser because it was huge. It was not editable via browser

--

* As a solution people access the Jenkins via SSH and changed the `config.xml` for the job with a text editor.

---

# Build is not in version control - III

* Travis-CI does this right with `.travis.yml`

--

* There is probably a Jenkins plugin which achieves the same

---

# Build differs between CI-Tool and localhost

```bash
bin
â”œâ”€â”€ build.bat
â”œâ”€â”€ build.sh
â””â”€â”€ build_on_jenkins.sh
```

--

* Issue where `build.sh` is updated and `build_on_jenkins.sh` is not.

--

* Could reveal `build_on_jenkins.sh` does more than build. Maybe it also deploys?

--

* Knowledge of deployment should be part of another job or step

---

# Build depends on global tooling

--

* Different `Node.js`, `karma` (Test Runner), `grunt-cli` (Task Runner) between jenkins and localhost

--

* Because build depends on having them installed globally

--

### Make the dependency visible and invoke via:

```shell
./node_modules/protractor/bin/protractor
```

--

### For Node.JS we can compare versions in build scripts

```javascript
var actualVersion = process.version
var expectedVersion = require('./package.json').engines.node
```

---

# Depend on nothing

* Make sure environment is built from scratch

--

* Avoid a build depending on artifacts of the previous build in the same workspace

--

* Jenkins: `"Delete workspace before build starts"`

--

* _"Yes but we only want to build and test the diff because its faster"_

---

# Travis-CI does this right

"Travis CI runs builds in isolated virtual machines that offer a <span class="yellow-highlight">vanilla build environment for every build</span>. This has the advantage that <span class="yellow-highlight">no state persists between builds</span>, offering a clean state and making sure that your tests run in an environment built from scratch." [Travis-CI docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#Overview)

---

# Merge Requests

--

* Protect the master branch with a preflight build.

--

* Best case: Don't let humans merge

???

Might seem like a joke but we had it a few times where the merge button was clicked 'accidentally'. e.g. on a mobile connection

---

# Merge Requests II

* The build on the feature branch should not differ from the one on master

--

* Build guarding the integration should not differ from the nightly-build

???
In two projects we had the case where the integration build was testing less, or different from the master

---

# Merge Requests III

* Accepting flaky tests

--

Using [pythons flaky](https://github.com/box/flaky):

```python
@flaky(max_runs=3, min_passes=2)
def test_something_that_usually_passes(self):
```

--

* Build Results switch between Pass and Fail

--

* Developers stop caring

--

* `"Well it's only red due to the flaky tests. So let's view it as green"`

--

* Release becomes:

```sh
1.) Brute-force retry release until flaky tests pass
2.) If its 7pm and they have not yet passed just disable them.
```

---

# Can the build run offline?

--
* Checking in dependenciesðŸ˜±?

--

* Fail/Pass does not depend on hitting third-party API

--

* Should our build test if the Facebook OAuth works?

--

* Build does not break on internet disconnects

--

* Can checkout any previous state and have all the dependencies present. See [npm left-pad package unpublished](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm)

???
Not sure about that one. What do you think?

In one project the connection was flaky and led to a red build in master multiple times.

# Branching is the path to the dark side. Branching leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.

---

# Avoid feature branches older than a day

--

* Can refactor in your branch without fear

--

* Get feedback quicker. Avoid doing the wrong thing.

--

* Can measure progress easier

--

* Can properly review smaller changes

???
Had reviews were non merged stuff was shown
Had feature branches sitting around for months.

# Indicators of having a huge merge request:

> "We're sorry, but it seems that the server timed out trying to fetch the diffs for your merge request. This typically means that the merge request is large. Please review changes locally"

---

class: center, middle

# Avoid branches getting older than a day?

## We can't merge half baked features!

---

# Feature Flag

--

_aka. Feature Toggle or Dark Feature_


--

* Turn off features or make them invisible in production

--

* Allows some stakeholders to get a preview of a feature.

--

* Once feature is complete it gets removed from the configuration file

---

# Feature Flag II

Example in Angular2

```html
<div *ngIf="featureFlags.isActive('RENT_CAR')">
  <a routerLink="/car-rental">Rent Car</a>
</div>
```

---

# Major impediments

If integrating is hard then we won't do it often enough.

--

* Builds are slow (Huge topic by itself)

--

* Having lots of necessary manual steps
